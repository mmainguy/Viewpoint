- Automate "deepening" of Model objects by over-riding method_missing
  â€¦ if object.is_shallow? && all_methods.index(method)
      deepen!
    else
      raise the NoMethod error

- Clean-up exceptions.  There is exception raising in the Model that will never ocurr because it is already being checked for in the Parser

- Refactor #find_folders methods.  There is a lot of duplicate code right now and it could be simplified quite a bit.
